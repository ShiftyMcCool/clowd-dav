# DAV Client Refactored Architecture

The DAVClient has been refactored from a single large file (~2000 lines) into smaller, focused modules organized by concern. This improves maintainability, testability, and code organization.

## Module Structure

### Core Modules

#### `HttpClient.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handles all HTTP communication with DAV servers
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Basic HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
  - DAV-specific methods (PROPFIND, REPORT)
  - Authentication handling
  - Request/response processing
  - Error handling
  - Development proxy URL conversion

#### `XmlParser.ts`
- **Purpose**: Parses XML responses from DAV servers
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Calendar discovery response parsing
  - Address book discovery response parsing
  - PROPPATCH response validation
  - XML value escaping utilities

#### `UrlBuilder.ts`
- **Purpose**: Constructs URLs for various DAV operations
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Calendar and address book discovery URLs
  - Event and contact resource URLs
  - Calendar and address book creation URLs
  - Development proxy URL conversion

#### `DataFormatters.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handles data format conversion between DAV formats and application objects
- **Responsibilities**:
  - iCalendar data generation and parsing (using ICAL.js)
  - vCard data generation and parsing (using vcard-parser)
  - Calendar event parsing from XML responses
  - Contact parsing from XML responses
  - Data escaping for iCal and vCard formats

### Service Modules

#### `CalendarService.ts`
- **Purpose**: Implements all CalDAV operations
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Calendar discovery
  - Event CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
  - Calendar CRUD operations
  - Calendar property updates
  - Date range filtering for events

#### `ContactService.ts`
- **Purpose**: Implements all CardDAV operations
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Address book discovery
  - Contact CRUD operations
  - Address book CRUD operations
  - Address book property updates

### Main Client

#### `DAVClient.ts`
- **Purpose**: Main facade that coordinates all DAV operations
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Implements the IDAVClient interface
  - Delegates operations to appropriate service modules
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing API

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- HTTP communication is separated from data parsing
- Calendar operations are separated from contact operations

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
- Changes to one concern don't affect others
- Easier to locate and fix bugs

### 3. **Better Testability**
- Each module can be unit tested independently
- Mock dependencies can be easily injected
- Test coverage can be more granular

### 4. **Code Reusability**
- Common functionality is extracted to helper modules
- XML parsing logic can be reused across services
- URL building logic is centralized

### 5. **Enhanced Readability**
- Related functionality is grouped together
- Less cognitive load when working on specific features
- Clear module boundaries and interfaces

## Usage

The refactored DAVClient maintains the same public API, so existing code continues to work without changes:

```typescript
import { DAVClient } from './services/DAVClient';

const client = new DAVClient();
client.setAuthConfig(authConfig);
client.setProvider(provider);

// All existing methods work the same way
const calendars = await client.discoverCalendars();
const events = await client.getEvents(calendar, dateRange);
```

## Individual Module Usage

If you need to use specific functionality, you can import individual modules:

```typescript
import { HttpClient, CalendarService } from './services/dav';

const httpClient = new HttpClient();
httpClient.setAuthConfig(authConfig);
httpClient.setProvider(provider);

const calendarService = new CalendarService(httpClient);
const calendars = await calendarService.discoverCalendars();
```

## File Size Reduction

- **Original**: Single file with ~2000 lines
- **Refactored**: 6 focused modules with average ~200-400 lines each
- **Main client**: Now only ~100 lines (mostly delegation)

This represents a significant improvement in code organization and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.
