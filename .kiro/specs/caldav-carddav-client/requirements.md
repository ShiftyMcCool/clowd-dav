# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a client-only web application that connects directly to CalDAV and CardDAV servers to provide users with calendar and contact management capabilities. The application runs entirely in the browser, storing all credentials and settings securely in browser local storage. Users can view, add, and edit calendar events and contacts through the web interface, with all data synchronized directly with their DAV servers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect to my CalDAV and CardDAV servers, so that I can access my existing calendar and contact data from a web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides CalDAV server credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and establish a connection to the CalDAV server
2. WHEN a user provides CardDAV server credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and establish a connection to the CardDAV server
3. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN connection is successful THEN the system SHALL store the connection configuration securely in browser local storage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my calendar events in a clear interface, so that I can see my schedule at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calendar view loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display all calendar events from the CalDAV server
2. WHEN displaying events THEN the system SHALL show event title, date, time, and duration
3. WHEN events span multiple days THEN the system SHALL display them appropriately across the date range
4. IF no events exist for a time period THEN the system SHALL display an empty state message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add new calendar events, so that I can schedule appointments and meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks to add an event THEN the system SHALL display an event creation form
2. WHEN a user submits a valid event THEN the system SHALL create the event on the CalDAV server
3. WHEN an event is successfully created THEN the system SHALL update the calendar display immediately
4. IF event creation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and retain the form data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit existing calendar events, so that I can update my schedule when plans change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an existing event THEN the system SHALL display an event editing form with current data
2. WHEN a user submits valid changes THEN the system SHALL update the event on the CalDAV server
3. WHEN an event is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the calendar display
4. IF event update fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and retain the form data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my contacts in an organized list, so that I can easily find and access contact information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the contacts view loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display all contacts from the CardDAV server
2. WHEN displaying contacts THEN the system SHALL show name, email, and phone number in a list format
3. WHEN contacts are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide search and filtering capabilities
4. IF no contacts exist THEN the system SHALL display an empty state message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add new contacts, so that I can build and maintain my address book.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks to add a contact THEN the system SHALL display a contact creation form
2. WHEN a user submits valid contact data THEN the system SHALL create the contact on the CardDAV server
3. WHEN a contact is successfully created THEN the system SHALL update the contacts display immediately
4. IF contact creation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and retain the form data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit existing contacts, so that I can keep contact information current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an existing contact THEN the system SHALL display a contact editing form with current data
2. WHEN a user submits valid changes THEN the system SHALL update the contact on the CardDAV server
3. WHEN a contact is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the contacts display
4. IF contact update fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and retain the form data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want my credentials and settings stored securely in my browser, so that I can use the application without relying on external servers while maintaining privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials are entered THEN the system SHALL store them encrypted in browser local storage
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve and decrypt stored credentials from local storage
3. WHEN a user clears their browser data THEN the system SHALL handle missing credentials gracefully
4. IF local storage is not available THEN the system SHALL inform the user that the application cannot function

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle network errors gracefully, so that I have a reliable experience even when connectivity issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network error occurs during data retrieval THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN a network error occurs during data submission THEN the system SHALL retain user input and allow retry
3. WHEN connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to sync pending changes
4. IF the server is unreachable THEN the system SHALL provide offline mode with cached data when available

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy the application using Docker with nginx as the web server, so that I can easily deploy and scale the application in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL provide a Dockerfile for a Docker container with nginx serving the static files
2. WHEN the Docker container starts THEN nginx SHALL serve the built React application on port 80
3. WHEN configuring nginx THEN the system SHALL include proper MIME types and compression for optimal performance
4. IF a user requests a non-existent route THEN nginx SHALL serve the index.html file to support client-side routing
