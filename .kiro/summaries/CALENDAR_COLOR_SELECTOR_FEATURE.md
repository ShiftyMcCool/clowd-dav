# Calendar Color Selector Feature

## Overview
Added a comprehensive color selector feature that allows users to customize calendar colors with both preset and custom color options. The selected colors are stored on the CalDAV server using the standard `calendar-color` property and synchronized across all devices and clients.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¨ Color Selector Component
- **Preset Colors**: 16 predefined colors matching the existing default palette
- **Custom Colors**: Color picker and hex input for unlimited color choices
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected color is highlighted with a checkmark
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

### ðŸ”§ Integration Points
- **Navigation Sidebar**: Click on any calendar's color indicator to open the color selector
- **Server Storage**: Colors are stored on the CalDAV server using PROPPATCH requests
- **Real-time Updates**: Calendar colors update immediately throughout the app
- **Offline Support**: Color changes work offline and sync when connection is restored

### ðŸ“± User Experience
- **Intuitive Interface**: Click the small colored circle next to any calendar name
- **Modal Design**: Non-intrusive overlay that can be closed by clicking outside
- **Hover Effects**: Color indicators have subtle hover animations for better discoverability

## Technical Implementation

### New Components
- `ColorPicker.tsx` - Unified color picker component supporting both embedded and modal modes
- `ColorPicker.css` - Responsive styling with theme support for both modes

### Enhanced Services
- `DAVClient.ts` - Added server color management:
  - `updateCalendarProperties()` - Update calendar properties on server
  - Enhanced calendar discovery to parse `calendar-color` property
- `SyncService.ts` - Added offline-capable color updates:
  - `updateCalendarColor()` - Update colors with offline support
  - Pending operations support for calendar property updates
- `calendarColors.ts` - Simplified to work with server colors:
  - `assignDefaultColorsIfMissing()` - Apply defaults only when server has no color

### Updated Components
- `Navigation.tsx` - Added color selector integration
- `App.tsx` - Added color change handler and state management

### Storage
- Calendar colors are stored on the CalDAV server using the `calendar-color` property
- Colors are synchronized across all devices and clients that support CalDAV
- Offline color changes are queued and synchronized when connection is restored
- Server-provided colors take precedence over default colors
